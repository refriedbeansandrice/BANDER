    <h1> BANDER </h1>
    <h2> About Us </h2>
    <h3>Meet the four loud girls who made this trash website.</h3>
    <h3>Abigail Quinsay</h3>
      <p>The quintessential piece to the Bander team. Without Abigail, our team would've
        gotten absolutely nothing done, and been all over the place. She is the
        reason that we have anything at all to showcase. On top of keeping our team grounded,
        Abigail is the brains behind our website's most important page- the browsing page; and
        she is the reason our website is interactive in any sense. We're incredibly thankful for her
        piles of intricate notes, specific direction, and keeping all our insane teammembers on track.

    </p>
    <h3>Molly Krasser</h3>
      <p>The style genius of the Bander team. She's worked her CSS and HTML
        magic on every page on Bander. She will make anything look nice.
        Molly is the reason why everything on Bander is not making your eyeballs
        bleed. She has also helped out other groups with their CSS. Her web design
        skills are not ending here. Get ready to see other websites profiling
        Molly's modelling, acting, etc. talents.
      </p>
    <h3>Rita Salas</h3>
      <p>Rita is the moodmaker of the Bander team. She keeps everyone positive with
        her motto "It's gonna be fine, guys." In addition to keeping everyone's spirits up,
        Rita is the Firebase (the database that contains all of Bander's users) master.
        She pretends like she knows nothing about it, but she'll find a way to help you.
        Rita's main task was creating the log-in page. She has helped out on so many other
        things like loading the profile page and troubleshooting in general.
      </p>
    <h3>Sonja Hendricks</h3>
      <p>The original idea of Bander came from this girl. Without her, Bander would
        never be the beatuiful thing that it is today. Sonja was tasked with making
        the Create a Profile page and she made it amazing. Because of her experience
        with the Create a Profile page, she has become the resident expert in drop
        down menus and forms. She's also really good with dictionaries by the way.
        Sonja has come up with many alternative names for Bander, highlights include:
        Whole Notes, Musical Soulmates, and uHarmony.
